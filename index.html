<h1>User Contributed Content for ExpOS</h1>

<p><b>Note:</b> This includes content related to both ExpOS (OS Lab) and EXPL (Compiler Lab). Because although they are offered as separate courses at NITC, they are closely related and dependent on each other. </p>

<section>
<h2Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Every year we have seen students come up with interesting content related to both the courses that are worth sharing. 
  For example, a few students came up with Docker scripts for simplifying the installation procedure. 
  Some students had shared vim and vscode extensions for syntax highlighting SPL files.
</p>
<p>
  The official documentation and the repositories are only updated at the end of each semester after rigorous review, to keep them as stable as possible.
  So we are providing a place here for the students and the community to share their own content.
  These will not be rigorously reviewed. 
  At the end of the semester we will consider the recognition of well made and popular content as official 
  and maintaining them along with other official material.

<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>
  The contributers should fork the repo and create a folder corresponding to their github userid.
  You can put any type of content there. Scripts, programs, cheat sheets, PDFs, etc. 
  The only requirement is that they should be related to ExpOS or EXPL.
  
  Your content may be either a written material, for example a blog post explaining some concept, 
  or something like a program or a script.
  
  If it is of the latter category, we encourage you to also provide a written material explaining how to use it for your fellow students.
  
  A link to thes written material should be added to posts.html in https://github.com/eXpOSNitc/user-contrib
  
  Written material can be in HTML, PDF or formats like .md, .rst which GitHub can render.
  If it is HTML or PDF, find out the link to it. For example: https://exposnitc.github.io/user-contrib/happycoder97/my_writeup.html.
  Then add this link to https://github.com/eXpOSNitc/user-contrib/blob/main/posts.html.
  If it is .md, .rst etc the link should be of the form https://github.com/eXpOSNitc/user-contrib/blob/main/happycoder97/my_writeup.md
  
  If you feel so, you can use frameworks like VueJS or tools like Hugo to create the HTML file.
  
  After you finish your work, you should send a pull request from your fork to the parent repo.
